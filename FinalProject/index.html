            <h2>Mote Lone (Sticker Design)</h2>
            <p>I designed stickers inspired by "Mote Lone," a traditional dessert enjoyed during Myanmar's Thingyan Festival. Mote Lone consists of sticky rice balls filled with sweet ingredients like jaggery and coconut, wrapped in banana leaves. </p>
            <p>My stickers capture the essence of Mote Lone, celebrating its flavors and cultural significance in the vibrant spirit of Thingyan.</p>

            <h2>36 Days of Type (Typography Design)</h2>
            <p>I participated in "36 Days of Type," a creative challenge where artists worldwide design and share letters and numbers each day for 36 days. My project showcased my versatility and creativity as I explored different styles and techniques to represent each character uniquely. </p>
            <p>It was a rewarding experience that allowed me to connect with a global community of designers and push the boundaries of my creativity.</p>
